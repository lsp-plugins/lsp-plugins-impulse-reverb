<p>
	This plugin performs highly optimized real time zero-latency convolution
	to the input signal. It can be used as a cabinet emulator, some sort of equalizer
	or as a reverb simulation plugin. All what is needed is audio file(s) with impulse
	response taken from the linear system (cabinet, equalizer or hall/room).
</p>
<p>
	Unlike the Impulsantworten (Impulse Responses) plugin series, up to four input files
	and convolution processors can be used to implement and mix different kinds of reverberations.
</p>
<?php if ($s) { ?>
<p>
	The stereo version of plugin allows to apply the True Stereo Reverberation effect to the input signal.
</p>
<p>
	To apply True Stereo Reverberation, the left input channel should be convolved with
	the left and right channels from the first impulse response file and the right input
	channel is convolved with the left and right channels from the second impulse response file or with
	third and fourth channels from the first impulse response file.
	The two output convolutions' respective left and right components should be then summed into
	a single stereo output. This configuration is necessary to take full advantage of true stereo
	impulse responses.
</p>
<p>
	By default, all controls of convolvers are set up to implement true stereo reverberation
	by setting left and right channels of input file as input source for convolvers 0 and 1,
	and also setting third and fourth channels of input file as input source for convolvers 2 and 3.
	If only stereo files are used to build true stereo reverberation then setting left and right channels of
	second input file as input source for convolvers 2 and 3 will take a true stereo reverberation effect.
</p>
<p>
	To use simple stereo reverberation on default settings, the left channel of input file can be set as
	source of convolver 0 and the right channel of input file can be set as source of convolver 3.
